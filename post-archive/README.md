Post-Archive Integration
========================

**There is a known bug where the final video in Opencast will be too short due to missing parts of the recording. A
  workaround is currently not available for Opencast 8!!!, but will be available with Opencast 9.**
- If you wish to have the workaround available in Opencast 8, you will have to backport [Opencast Pull Request #1898](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/1898)
    - You will also have to uncomment two lines in the `bbb-upload.xml`
    
The Idea
--------

We want to record BigBlueButton meetings.  
But we don't want process and publish them through BBB, but with Opencast.  
So we send all the raw recording data from BBB to Opencast and process them with an Opencast workflow.  

Requirements
--------
- Opencast 8.4 (or later)
- BigBlueButton 2.2 (or later)
	- Ruby gems: rest-client, fileutils, streamio-ffmpeg, toml-rb
  - Command line tools: rsvg-convert

Files:
--------
post_archive.rb: A ruby script that handles sending data from BBB to Opencast.  
bbb-upload.xml: An Opencast workflow for processing BBB data.  
bbb-publish-after-cutting.xml: An Opencast workflow for publish an even that was processed with bbb-upload.xml in the VideoEditor.

Setup BBB
--------
- If the required ruby gems are not yet installed, manually install the ruby gems mentioned under requirements via `gem install *name*`. They are used by the post_archive.rb script.
- Install the command line tool rsvg-convert: `sudo apt-get install librsvg2-bin`
- Place the script `post_archive.rb` in
    
    `/usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/scripts/post_archive/`

    Place the configuration file `post_archive_config.toml` in the same location.
    
    Place the folder `oc_modules` from the top-level of this repository in the same location.
    
    `/usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/scripts/post_archive/oc_modules`
- In the config `post_archive_config.toml`, change the variables in the "opencast" group:
	- Change the variable `server` to point to your Opencast installation
	- Also change `user` and `password` to a user of your opencast installation that is allowed to ingest (e.g. ROLE_ADMIN)
		- Alternatively, you can use ROLE_CAPTURE_AGENT for more restricted access rights
	- When using with any Opencast version earlier than 9.1: In the group `addFiles`, set `webcamTracks` to `false`.
	- Change the remaining options how you like.

- Disable the process and publish steps by calling: `sudo bbb-record --disable presentation`
- Ensure BBB is configured for recording. In `/usr/share/bbb-web/WEB-INF/classes/bigbluebutton.properties` the parameter
  `disableRecordingDefault` should be set to false.
	- In the same file, set `autoStartRecording` to true and `allowStartStopRecording` to false to reflect the current limitations.
	    - Skip this step when using Opencast 9.2 with automatic recording enabled.
	- For changes in bigbluebutton.properties to take effect, BBB needs to be restarted using `bbb-conf --restart`
- Depending on your deployment process, the two above BBB configuration changes may get overwritten when updating BBB.
  To ensure that does not happen, you can use `apply-config.sh` bash script offered by BBB (Details at: https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.2/customize.html#apply-confsh)
- Allow post scripts to call the `bbb-record` utility by adding the line `bigbluebutton ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/bbb-record` to `/etc/sudoers`

Setup Opencast
--------
- In your Opencast installation, add the file `bbb-upload.xml` to the workflow folder (Likely located at `etc/workflows` or `etc/opencast/workflows`)
  - When using Opencast 9.1: Use `bbb-upload-9.xml` instead of `bbb-upload.xml` to also enable webcams. Make sure to only have one of them in your Workflow directory.
  - When using Opencast 9.2 (or higher): Use `bbb-upload-9-2.xml` instead of `bbb-upload.xml` to also enable automatic cutting. Make sure to only have one of them in your Workflow directory.
  - When using Opencast 9.3 (or higher): Use `bbb-upload-9-3.xml` instead of `bbb-upload.xml` to enable the above and increase processing speed. Make sure to only have one of them in your Workflow directory.
  - When using Opencast 10.4 (or higher): Use `bbb-upload-10-4.xml` instead of `bbb-upload.xml` to enable the above and reduce memory consumption for concat operations. Make sure to only have one of them in your Workflow directory.
- Add the file `bbb-publish-after-cutting.xml`. This will add a new Publish option to the VideoEditor, which needs to be used when cutting videos after they have been uploaded from BBB.
- In the Admin-UI, create the user you entered in the post_archive.rb during "Setup BBB"
- When using Opencast 8.6 or lower: Apply a fix in the file `/etc/encoding/opencast-images.properties` by assigning the variable `profile.import.image-frame.ffmpeg.command` the value `-sseof -3 -i #{in.video.path} -update 1 -q:v 1 #{out.dir}/#{out.name}#{out.suffix}`.
- Please adjust the snapshot workflow operation in the `partial-error.xml` workflow archiving the flavors `smil/source+partial,etherpad/sharednotes,json/times,captions/*` to avoid source data loss in case of processing errors.

Limitations & Take Cares
--------
- Currently, only audio, deskshare and raw slides (no marks) are transmitted.
    - **When using Opencast 9.1** or higher, webcams can be enabled. This will generate a single video file from all the webcam recordings. Details can be found in the setup instructions.
      - The webcam operation in Opencast CAN FAIL for a large number of webcams. Anything beyond 30 simultaneous webcams may lead to a workflow error.
- Currently processes and publishes the WHOLE conference, not just when you click the start/stop recording button
	- To get rid of the parts you don't want, use the video editor tool in Opencast
	- **When using Opencast 9.2** or higher, automatic cutting can be enabled. This will cut the video files in accordance with the start/stop button being pressed. Details can be found in the setup instructions.
- After successfully transmitting the recording to Opencast, all data related to the recording on the BBB installation WILL BE DELETED! While Opencast will immediately make a snapshot upon receiving the recording data, IN CASE OF AN ERROR THIS CAN LEAD TO LOST DATA!
	- If you don't want that, set the variable `$deleteIfSuccessful` to `false`.
- The recording is published with a few default metadata values. To set further metadata, the frontend which creates the
  BBB-Meeting will need pass them when calling the `/create` API, so that BBB then may pass them on to Opencast. 
  An overview over the possible metadata can be found [here](https://github.com/elan-ev/opencast-bigbluebutton-integration).
- The time between the end of a BBB Meeting and the recording appearing in Opencast depends largely on the number of 
  files generated. A simple test meeting should take something between 30-60 seconds. 
	- In certain edge cases (video recordings with uneven resolutions), there may still be some preprocessing necessary 
	  on BBB side, greatly increasing the time until the recording appears in Opencast.
- The BBB-Upload workflow for Opencast relies on the partial workflows `partial-preview.xml` and `partial-publish.xml`
  from the official Opencast installation. If these partial workflows are changed in your installation, you will need
  to change the BBB-Uploads workflows accordingly.
- When editing a video in the Videoeditor after it has been uploaded from BBB, use the option *Publish (BBB)* instead of
  the normal Publish.
- For longer meetings or meetings with high quality video files (e.g. a one hour and a half seminar with ten HD webcams and an HD screenshare), certain Opencast jobs will require quite a bit of working memory
  - For the above example, at least 16GB of RAM are recommended for the workers
  - There can still be errors in case multiple memory intensive jobs run on the same worker server at the same time. To help ensure that those jobs run in isolation, you can increase the "Job Load" for the "concat.work" encoding profile (found in `etc/encoding/opencast-movies.properties`). For information on how to correctly use job load, see the opencast documentation [here](https://docs.opencast.org/r/9.x/admin/#configuration/load/#step-3-setting-the-load-values-for-encoding-profiles).

Troubleshooting
--------
1. General actions to take
	- Check the logs
		- `/var/log/bigbluebutton/bbb-rap-worker.log`, for potential exceptions
		- `/var/log/bigbluebutton/post_archive.log`, for additional information
	- Secure the recording data
		- Or else it might get lost during regularly scheduled clean-ups
		- `/var/bigbluebutton/recording/raw/` is where the raw recording data is stored
	- If the problem could be resolved, try again
		- Run `sudo bbb-record --rebuild *path/to/recording*` on your BBB installation
		- `/var/bigbluebutton/recording/raw/` is where the raw recording data is stored
2. The Opencast workflow failed
	- Check if the bbb-upload workflow was used. If not, check your configuration and try ingesting from BBB again.
	- Failed with an error message like "ffmpeg exited with error code 137"
		- The opencast server likely ran out of working memory. Implement the steps described in "Limitations & Take Cares" and then try again.
	- Failed with "VideoGridServiceException: No response from service"
		 - The recording likely contains too many webcam videos. This is a current limitation in the Opencast workflow. Try again with significantly less webcam videos.
	 - Failed with "The audio [..] could not be encoded by the encoding profile 'editor.work' with the properties 'EMPTY'."
	 	- With corresponding error message "FFMPEG: Too many packets buffered for output stream 0:1" in the Opencast logs on the worker node.
	 	- A solution to this error is currently unknown.
	 	- A suggested solution to this issue is to add the flag `-max_muxing_queue_size 1024` to the relevant encoding profile, but this causes the audio to get lost and is thus not recommendend.

4. The BBB logs contain "504 Request Timeout" errors
	- Check if the recording arrived at Opencast or not. Sometimes Opencast will respond with an error even though there was none. This is a bug in Opencast.
	- The timeout is due to Opencast processing time. Opencast inspects every media file before sending out a response. While this process has become dramatically faster since Opencast 8.10, it may still take longer than your (reverse) proxy timeout. In that case, you can try increasing your (reverse) proxy timeout to circumvent this problem.
	- There is an actual network problem that prevents clean communication between BBB and Opencast.
